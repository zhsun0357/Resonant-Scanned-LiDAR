# Resonant-Scanned-LiDAR
Scripts for the paper "Phase Controlled Resonant Scanner for Fast Spatial Sampling" simulation part.
arXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12996

In this repository, we will include three useful scripts related to the paper:
1. Resonant scanning pattern optimization with binary Regions-of-Interest (fast implementation).
2. Resonant scanning pattern optimization with float valued Regions-of-Interest.
3. LiDAR odometry based on resonantly scanned point cloud.
